# CodeInPlace2021_BibliographyGraph
Let's say you want to start "researching" a field that you have no idea about. You go to IEEE Xplore/ google and type some words and get some papers. What this code does is, takes the reference of those papers in a .txt file, then uses the concepts of dictionary and list to come up with extremely interesting network graphs to guide you in your literature survey.

The main file is Final_Project_MainFile_Graph.py
